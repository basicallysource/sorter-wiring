# Regenerate everything under static/harness/ from the WireViz sources in

# hand-edit to any of them is silently reverted the next time this runs.

#   ./scripts/build-harness.sh
#
# Needs `wireviz` and graphviz's `dot` on PATH. CI installs both; locally,
# `pip install wireviz==0.4.1` and `brew install graphviz`.
#
# Output is byte-for-byte reproducible, which is what lets CI commit only
# when a drawing actually changed rather than on every run:
#
#   - dot's PDF writer stamps a creation time into a compressed object, so
#     a PDF is only rebuilt when the .gv it comes from actually changed.
#     SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH below pins the stamp on a graphviz new enough to
#     honour it and is not sufficient on its own: graphviz 2.43, which is
#     what Ubuntu 24.04 and therefore CI has, ignores it, and the resulting
#     PDFs differed by one byte per run and committed on every run. The .gv
#     is WireViz's own output and carries no timestamp, so it is the honest
#     thing to key on.
#   - zip stores mtimes, so the archive is built by Python with a fixed
#     timestamp and a fixed member order instead of the zip(1) binary. Its
#     members are stable by the rule above, so it needs no guard of its own.
#
# The version of graphviz IS part of the output: it shifts glyph positions,
# so a different one rewrites every PNG, SVG and HTML at once. CI pins it
# (2.42.2, Ubuntu 24.04's) and CI is the canonical renderer. Running this
# locally on a newer graphviz is fine and useful for looking at a change,
# but expect the images to come back different and expect CI to normalise
# them on the next push. Only bump the pin in the workflow deliberately;
# it lands as one rebaseline commit touching images and nothing else.
